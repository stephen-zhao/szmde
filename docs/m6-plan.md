# M6 — Android (implementation plan)

_Implementation plan for milestone **M6** (see [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) "M6" for the requirement
slotting and [SPEC.md](../SPEC.md) §2 / §6 / §7 for the behavior). SPEC.md is the "what"; this doc is
the "how" — architecture + staged `S<n>` slices. Same shape as the archived m1–m5 plans. Grounded by a
cited research pass (2026-07-18); every device-dependent claim is flagged for on-device verification._

_Status legend: ✅ done · 🔜 next · ⬜ planned._

## Scope (from roadmap "M6" / SPEC §2)

Make szmde run as a **native Android app** on Tauri 2 mobile (GA since 2024-10-02; the local CLI
2.11.3 already ships `tauri android {init,dev,build,run}`). Three requirements:

| REQ | Requirement | SPEC |
|-----|-------------|------|
| REQ-MOBILE-1 | Tauri 2 Android build → installable APK/AAB | §2 |
| REQ-MOBILE-2 | Responsive UI from desktop windows down to phone widths (touch, soft keyboard, safe-areas) | §7 |
| REQ-MOBILE-3 | Storage Access Framework / scoped-storage backend (open/save real device files) | §6 |

**Guiding principle — local-first.** Prove the app *boots*, make it *phone-usable*, ship a fully
**offline** Android editor that opens/saves real files via SAF, cut a *signed* build — and only then
port **Drive sign-in**. M6 is shippable as a local-only Android editor; cloud is additive.

**Scope (decided 2026-07-18):** M6 = **S1–S6** (local-first + Drive sign-in). The native Drive
**Picker** (opening *pre-existing* Drive files, was S7) is **deferred to M6.1** — the highest-uncertainty
item. **Distribution** for M6 is a **sideload signed APK**; the **Play Store** release is its own later
milestone (**REQ-PLAY-1**). The Android OAuth redirect is an **https App Link**. See
[Decisions](#decisions-resolved-2026-07-18--stephen).

**Follow-ons (parked out of the M6 line):** **M6.1** = the native Drive Picker. **M6.2** =
the [Touch UX pass](#m62--touch-ux-pass) (`REQ-UI-4`, `REQ-TBLED-8/9`), scoped 2026-07-20 from the
first on-device review. Framing that matters: **M6 makes szmde _run_ on Android; M6.2 makes it
_usable_.** M6's acceptance is deliberately "boots, is responsive, opens/saves files" — a shipped
feature being *unreachable* by touch (Find, table editing) is out of M6's scope but is squarely M6.2's.

## The big shift: three desktop seams carry over, their tails change

szmde's M3 architecture already isolated the platform-specific bits behind three seams, so **most of
the app is reused unchanged** and Android only adds new backends behind them:

| Seam (shared, unchanged) | Desktop tail | Android tail (new) |
|--------------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| `StorageProvider` (`src/lib/storage/provider.ts`) | `LocalProvider` → Rust `read_file_meta`/`write_file` over `std::fs` **paths** | `SafProvider` over SAF `content://` URIs (scoped storage) |
| OAuth core (`oauth.ts`, `cloud-http.ts`, `tauri-transport.ts` — PKCE, token exchange/refresh, Drive REST) | `127.0.0.1` loopback capture (`oauth_loopback_await`, `oauth_pick_await`) | **deep-link** redirect capture (`tauri-plugin-deep-link`) |
| `SecureStore` (`secure-store.ts` → Rust `secure_*` via `keyring`) | Windows Credential Manager (`keyring` v3) | Android Keystore (`keyring` **v4** `android-native-keyring-store`) |

The Rust entry point needs **no restructuring**: `lib.rs` already has
`#[cfg_attr(mobile, tauri::mobile_entry_point)] pub fn run()`, `main.rs` just calls it, and
`Cargo.toml` already declares `crate-type = ["staticlib","cdylib","rlib"]`. `tauri-plugin-single-instance`
is already desktop-gated.

## Prerequisites — YOUR toolchain setup (before S1)

The assistant **cannot** do these (they need the Android SDK + your machine + Google/Play accounts).
szmde is the documented **Windows-native** exception to the WSL-first rule, so set these up
Windows-native. _Provisioned 2026-07-19 (S1): JDK 17 + `JAVA_HOME`, `ANDROID_HOME`/`NDK_HOME`, NDK 30, all
4 rustup Android targets, and a committed `src-tauri/gen/android`. Still pending for on-device work:
**Windows Developer Mode** (Tauri symlinks the built `.so` into `jniLibs` — the build fails without it) and
an **AVD/physical device**._

1. **Android Studio** → SDK Manager: install *SDK Platform* (**API 36** — we compile/target 36),
   *Platform-Tools*, *Build-Tools*, *Command-line Tools*, and *NDK (Side by side)* — **NDK r28+ is
   required** for the 16 KB memory-page support that Android 16 / Play enforce. Accept licenses
   (`sdkmanager --licenses`) or Gradle fails.
2. **JDK 17** with `JAVA_HOME` pointing at it (Android Studio's bundled JBR works). Java 1.8 errors
   with *"Android Gradle plugin requires Java 17"*; **do not** use JDK 21/26 (they conflict with
   Tauri's bundled Gradle 8.14.x).
3. **Env vars** (Windows PowerShell, per Tauri docs — missing `NDK_HOME` is a very common `init` failure):
   ```powershell
   [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ANDROID_HOME", "$env:LocalAppData\Android\Sdk", "User")
   $VERSION = Get-ChildItem -Name "$env:LocalAppData\Android\Sdk\ndk" | Select-Object -Last 1
   [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("NDK_HOME", "$env:LocalAppData\Android\Sdk\ndk\$VERSION", "User")
   ```
4. **Rust targets:** `rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android`
5. **A test device:** an AVD (e.g. Pixel, API 35/36 x86_64) and/or a physical phone with USB debugging
   (needed for the on-device slices S3 keyboard/IME, S6 keystore/deep-link).
6. **(Cloud, S6/S7)** In Google Cloud Console, create a **separate Android OAuth client** for
   `com.zhaostephen.szmde` keyed by the **debug AND release SHA-1** (`keytool -list -v -keystore …`).
   The existing Windows *Desktop* client cannot be reused (Google requires one client per platform).
7. **(Release, S5)** Generate an upload keystore once, kept out of git:
   `keytool -genkey -v -keystore upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload`.

---

## Architecture decisions

1. **Storage seam — shared interface, new backend.** `StorageProvider` (read/write/stat, `Revision`,
   `StorageError` taxonomy) does **not** change. The desktop `LocalProvider` (raw `std::fs` paths) still
   *compiles* for Android but hits the scoped-storage sandbox at runtime, so it isn't used for user
   documents there. Add a **`SafProvider`** whose `path` is a SAF `content://` URI string, register it
   in `ProviderRegistry` conditionally on platform so open/save call sites and
   `settings.storage.defaultProvider` stay untouched (recommend it keep the id `"local"`).
2. **SAF revision model — mirror the local rev.** `LocalProvider` composes `rev = {mtime_nanos}-{len}`;
   `SafProvider` composes `rev = {DocumentFile.lastModified()}-{length}`, so REQ-SAVE-1 conflict
   detection works verbatim. If `lastModified` proves unreliable across SAF document providers, degrade
   `capabilities.conflictDetection = false` (the shell already tolerates a null baseline rev) rather
   than corrupt the check-and-set.
3. **SAF mechanism — prefer existing plugins, hand-write Kotlin only if needed.** On Android
   `tauri-plugin-dialog`'s `open()`/`save()` invoke the SAF picker and return a `content://` URI;
   `tauri-plugin-fs` can read/write that URI via `FilePath::Url` (it **cannot** list a directory or
   create-in-directory from a URI — fine, szmde opens/saves single files). The gap is **persistable
   permissions** (`takePersistableUriPermission`, for re-open across launches) and `DocumentFile`
   metadata (the rev token); the community **`tauri-plugin-android-fs`** (aiueo13) covers both
   (`Picker` + `AndroidFs` APIs) but is young (no tagged releases — vet it). **S4 spikes the
   official dialog+fs path first**, then adds `tauri-plugin-android-fs` or a minimal custom Kotlin
   plugin for persistence + metadata.
4. **Settings storage — no SAF.** `user.json`/settings live in app-private storage (SPEC §8), writable
   with plain `std::fs` — no picker. Give the settings backend a mobile path targeting Tauri's
   app-config dir; SAF is only for user-chosen document files.
5. **OAuth — shared core, new redirect capture.** PKCE, token exchange/refresh, and Drive REST over
   plugin-http are unchanged. The `127.0.0.1` loopback is **invalid on Android** (Google deprecated
   loopback for mobile; custom URI schemes default-disabled for new Android clients since 2023-10-02).
   On mobile, the redirect is a **deep link** captured by `tauri-plugin-deep-link` v2
   (`onOpenUrl`/`getCurrent`), the auth launched in a Chrome Custom Tab; `gdrive-connect.ts`'s
   `redirectUri` is mobile-gated to the deep-link URL. Requires the separate Android OAuth client.
6. **Drive Picker — new native path, highest uncertainty.** The desktop Picker (`trigger_onepick` over
   the loopback, `oauth_pick_await` → `picked_file_ids`) can't fire on Android. The Android Picker is a
   native Google Identity Services `AuthorizationRequest` with the `PICKER_OAUTH_TRIGGER` resource
   (Kotlin — likely a second custom plugin) returning `picked_file_ids` to the deep-link redirect;
   `drive.file`-only. **Deferred to M6.1** (out of the M6 line — decision 1, 2026-07-18).
7. **Secure store — shared contract, Cargo bump only.** `secure_*` + `TauriSecureStore` stay
   byte-for-byte. Bump `keyring = { version = "3", features = ["apple-native","windows-native"] }` →
   `keyring = "4"`. **This bump is required even to cross-compile for Android** (v3 has no Android
   backend). ⚠️ **Corrected 2026-07-19 (S1, on device):** v4's default `v1` feature covers
   **Windows/Apple/Linux only** — the resolved tree has `apple-native` / `windows-native` /
   `zbus-secret-service` stores and **no Android store**, and the companion
   `android-native-keyring-store` (Android-Keystore-encrypted SharedPreferences over JNI, minSdk 24)
   does **NOT** auto-register. It must be added as an explicit `cfg(target_os="android")` dependency
   **and registered as keyring-core's default store**; otherwise every `secure_*` call fails at runtime
   (see risk #2). Do **not** use Stronghold (deprecated) or androidx
   `EncryptedSharedPreferences` (deprecated 2025-04); fallback is `tauri-plugin-keyring` v0.2.0.
8. **Responsive — shared CSS shell, additive.** The shell already sizes with `100dvh` and a bare
   viewport meta. Add `interactive-widget=resizes-content` + `viewport-fit=cover` (since Chromium 108
   the soft keyboard resizes only the *visual* viewport, so `dvh`/`svh` don't shrink for it —
   `resizes-content` shrinks the *layout* viewport so CM6's caret scrolls into view). Add a phone
   (`<600px`) breakpoint collapsing the sidebar/`HamburgerMenu` into a drawer, ≥48dp tap targets,
   `touch-action:manipulation`, `overscroll-behavior:none`, and `env(safe-area-inset-*)` wrapped in
   `max(…, fallback)` (env() returns 0 on WebView <M136; **targetSdk 36 / Android 16 makes edge-to-edge
   mandatory** — no opt-out — which is exactly why we handle insets rather than opt out).
   Keep CM6 **contenteditable-native** selection (do not override `contentAttributes` in ways that break
   native touch selection/IME).
9. **Rust cfg gating — one `run()`, two modes.** Gate the CLI launcher (`parse_cli`/`env::args`/
   `LaunchFile`) and the loopback OAuth commands under `#[cfg(desktop)]` (no launch args / no loopback
   on mobile); add `#[cfg(mobile)]` registrations for the deep-link + SAF/Picker plugins.

## Per-REQ impact

- **REQ-MOBILE-1** — toolchain + `keyring` 3→4 (to cross-compile) + `cfg(desktop)`-gate the CLI +
  `tauri android init` (commit `src-tauri/gen/android`; it ships nested `.gitignore`s that exclude only
  build artifacts). `tauri android dev` boots the static SvelteKit SPA in the WebView with **no frontend
  rewrite** (adapter-static + `ssr=false` + `frontendDist:"../build"` already in place; only the Vite
  dev server must bind to `TAURI_DEV_HOST`/`0.0.0.0` for device HMR). `tauri android build` (no flag) →
  both APK + AAB; release AAB at `gen/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/universalRelease/…-release.aab`,
  unsigned release APK at `…/apk/universal/release/…-release-unsigned.apk`. minSdk default 24 via
  `bundle.android.minSdkVersion`.
- **REQ-MOBILE-2** — additive CSS on the shared shell (see architecture #8). Highest risk: CM6 caret
  visibility next to inline widgets during IME composition + the soft-keyboard layout-viewport behavior
  — both need real-device proof.
- **REQ-MOBILE-3** — the core M6 deliverable: `SafProvider` + the SAF plugin path (architecture #1–3).
- **REQ-SEC-1 (parity on Android)** — `keyring` 3→4 only; contract unchanged; verify auto-registration +
  ndk-context on device.
- **REQ-CLOUD-1 (parity on Android)** — deep-link redirect + separate Android OAuth client; PKCE/refresh/
  Drive REST unchanged. Enables sign-in + read/write of already-known file IDs.
- **REQ-CLOUD-3 (parity on Android)** — native GIS Picker (`PICKER_OAUTH_TRIGGER`); **deferred to M6.1**
  (decision 1), out of the M6 line.
- **REQ-CLOUD-2 (OneDrive)** — out of M6 scope (already deferred/backend-only).

## Staged slices

| Slice | Title | REQ | Acceptance |
|-------|-------|-----|-----------|
| **S1** | Boots on emulator (toolchain + `android init` + cross-compile) | REQ-MOBILE-1 | Provision the toolchain; bump `keyring` 3→4; `cfg(desktop)`-gate the CLI; `tauri android init` + commit `gen/android`; set minSdk 24 (compileSdk/targetSdk 36 are the template default — no edit). **`tauri android dev` launches the blank editor in an emulator; `cargo build` succeeds for all 4 ABIs; desktop `tauri dev` + `npm test` still green.** No storage/cloud/keyboard yet. |
| **S2** | Responsive shell down to phone width | REQ-MOBILE-2 | Viewport meta + phone `<600` breakpoint (drawer), ≥48dp targets, safe-area insets. **Toolbar/drawer/editor usable by touch on a phone-sized emulator, no horizontal overflow, content clears system-bar insets; desktop layout unchanged.** Soft keyboard deferred to S3. |
| **S3** ✅ | Soft-keyboard + IME correctness (on-device) | REQ-MOBILE-2 | **Done 2026-07-20.** The planned CSS-only route (`interactive-widget=resizes-content` + `visualViewport`) could not work as specced — see risk #4 — so it shipped as a **native IME-inset bridge** in `MainActivity.kt` publishing `--kb-inset`, with CSS shrinking `.app` and lifting `.statusbar`. **Verified on a physical Pixel 9 Pro:** `--kb-inset` 373px, `.app` 952→579, statusbar 32→381px. ⚠️ **The acceptance is only PARTLY met, and the original claim here was wrong** (caught by the S3 adversarial review): after typing 18 lines the active line rests at y=555–578, while the fixed status chips occupy y=509–571 — so the caret clears the *keyboard* but the line being typed is **overpainted by the chips**. That is exactly the complaint that prompted `REQ-SCROLL-1`, and the measurement I originally quoted as a pass is precisely the failing case. **S3 delivers the mechanism; the UX is not usable until REQ-SCROLL-1 (typewriter scrolling) lands** — centring the active line resolves it, which is why that REQ is a prerequisite for calling REQ-MOBILE-2 done, not optional polish. _Also not exercised: IME **composition** (CJK/predictive) next to inline widgets, and table-cell editing with the keyboard up — see WF-30._ |
| **S4** | SAF local storage backend (offline open/save) | REQ-MOBILE-3 | Spike dialog+fs (`content://` via `FilePath::Url`); add `SafProvider` + persistable permissions + `DocumentFile` rev; settings via app-private `std::fs`. **On-device: pick a real `.md`, edit, save back (with conflict detection), reopen after app restart via the persisted URI — fully offline.** The milestone's core shippable. |
| **S5** | Signed release AAB/APK + Android CI | REQ-MOBILE-1 | Upload keystore + `signingConfigs`; a GitHub Actions job (setup-java 17 + SDK/NDK + the 4 targets, keystore from base64 secrets) building `--apk`/`--aab`. **CI produces a signed APK installable on a device + a signed AAB.** A local-only Android szmde is shippable here. |
| **S6** | Cloud sign-in on Android (deep-link OAuth + keystore verify) | REQ-CLOUD-1 | Verify `keyring` v4 round-trip on device; add `tauri-plugin-deep-link` + the redirect (App Link recommended) + separate Android OAuth client; mobile-gate `gdrive-connect.ts`. **`connectGoogleDrive` completes in a Custom Tab, tokens persist in the Keystore, refresh works, read/write of a known Drive file ID succeeds.** |
| **S7 → M6.1** | Android Drive Picker (open pre-existing files) — **deferred out of M6** (decision 1) | REQ-CLOUD-3 | Native GIS `AuthorizationRequest` Kotlin plugin (`PICKER_OAUTH_TRIGGER`, `drive.file`) → `picked_file_ids` via deep link; mobile-gate `pickGoogleDriveFiles`. **On-device: pick a pre-existing Drive file via the native Picker and open it read/write.** Highest uncertainty — lands in **M6.1**, after the M6 local + Drive-sign-in line ships. |

## M6.2 — Touch UX pass

_Scoped 2026-07-20 from Stephen's first on-device Android review. Parked out of the M6 line so the
local-first S1–S6 ships first._

**One root cause.** szmde's interaction model was built for a **fine pointer (hover + right-click) and
a keyboard**. On a coarse pointer those inputs simply don't exist, so affected features don't degrade
gracefully — they become **completely unreachable**. Every gap below was verified in code, not assumed:

| Assumed input | Where it's load-bearing | Consequence on touch |
|---------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Keyboard (`Mod-f`) | Find & Replace has **no** hamburger entry — only `searchKeymap` | REQ-FR-1 (shipped M4) **cannot be opened at all** |
| `:hover` | Table insert/delete gizmos are `display:none` until `th:hover`/`td:hover`; drag handles hover-revealed (`theme.ts`) | gizmos **never appear** |
| Right-click | Table action menu is bound to `contextmenu` (`tables.ts`, `table-source-gizmos.ts`) | menu **never opens** |
| Content width | Cell size is content-driven; `tables.ts` sets no min width/height | an empty N×M scaffold **collapses to untappable slivers** |

### Slices

| Slice | Title | REQ | Acceptance |
|-------|-------|-----|-----------|
| **T1** | Command reachability (Find entry + audit) | REQ-UI-4 | Add **Find & Replace** to the hamburger, then audit the *whole* command surface for keyboard-/hover-/right-click-only paths and give each a pointer-agnostic entry. **On a touch-only device every shipped command can be invoked without a keyboard, hover or right-click.** ⚠️ Do T1's Find entry **together with** the `.cm-panels-top` inset below — opening Find on a phone is what first *exposes* that bug. |
| **T2** | Empty tables/cells stay targetable | REQ-TBLED-8 | Minimum rendered cell width/height + visible empty-cell boundaries + placeholder affordances for empty cells/rows/columns. **A freshly inserted N×M scaffold is visible and tappable before anything is typed**, on both pointer types. Also re-size the `TableSizePicker` grid cells (16×16px today, hover-only preview). |
| **T3** | Coarse-pointer table structural editing | REQ-TBLED-9 | The redesign: a touch-first path to insert/delete/move rows+columns (e.g. tap-to-select-cell → persistent action bar, or long-press → action sheet), with hover/right-click kept as a fine-pointer *enhancement*, not the only route. **Every REQ-TBLED-3/4/5 action is reachable by touch alone on a phone.** Largest slice — treat as its own design spike first. |

### Also folded into M6.2 (open findings from the S2 adversarial review, 2026-07-20)

- **`.cm-panels-top` has no top safe-area inset** — the Find panel lays out at viewport y=0, inside the
  measured 52px status-bar band. Currently masked because Find is keyboard-only; **T1 unmasks it**, so
  fix both together. Belongs on `.cm-panels.cm-panels-top` (additive `env()` padding), *not* on
  `.cm-editor`/`.app` — insetting the container would double-count against `.cm-content`'s top padding.
- **Conflict-modal action row overflows at ≤375px** — the primary "Overwrite" button can be clipped
  off-screen at small display sizes.
- **Text scrolls under the status bar** — `.cm-content`'s top padding clears the *first* screen only
  (M6 S2). A genuine design call for M6.2: immersive edge-to-edge vs. inset content.

_Reviewed and **accepted as-is by Stephen** (2026-07-20) — not defects, do not "fix" without asking:
the current control sizes, i.e. status chips at 34px and dropdown / chip-menu rows at 44px, below the
≥48dp guidance._

## Risks (need on-device verification)

1. **Cross-compile is risk #1** — whether the existing desktop Rust actually builds for
   `aarch64-linux-android` after cfg-gating; the `keyring` 3→4 bump is a hard prerequisite just to
   compile. A real `cargo build` per ABI is the S1 gate.
2. ⚠️ **CONFIRMED on device (2026-07-19, S1) — this risk materialized.** `keyring` v4 does **not**
   auto-register an Android store. The app boots fine, but any `secure_*` call rejects at runtime with
   _"No default store has been set, so cannot search or create entries"_ (seen in logcat as
   `E Tauri/Console` on first launch, from the startup Drive-connection check). **Fix (S6):** add
   `android-native-keyring-store` as a `cfg(target_os="android")` dependency and register it as the
   default store, then verify the round-trip on device. Fallback remains `tauri-plugin-keyring`.
3. CM6 caret invisible next to inline widgets during IME composition (widget-heavy editor) — physical
   device + real IME only.
4. ✅ **RESOLVED (S3, 2026-07-20) — but read the correction below before trusting any of it.**
   **What is true, measured on a PHYSICAL Pixel 9 Pro / Android 16 with a real docked keyboard:**
   `interactive-widget=resizes-content` does **not** resize the layout viewport — `innerHeight` stays
   952 with the IME up (confirms Tauri #10631). `android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"` is **also**
   inert, because a targetSdk 35+ edge-to-edge app no longer gets automatic IME resizing; it must
   consume `WindowInsets.ime()` itself. So `100dvh` alone can never shrink for the keyboard.
   **Shipped fix:** a native bridge in `MainActivity.kt` (editable + committed; `TauriActivity.kt` is
   auto-generated — don't touch) overriding `WryActivity.onWebViewCreate` to publish the IME inset as
   CSS `--kb-inset`, via a `WindowInsetsAnimation` callback. CSS shrinks `.app` by it (so CodeMirror
   gets a correct visible height and its own caret `scrollIntoView` works) and lifts `.statusbar`.
   `adjustResize` is kept for API 24–34, where the framework still resizes and `--kb-inset` stays 0.
   **Verified on device:** `--kb-inset` 373px, `.app` 952→579, `.cm-scroller` 579, statusbar bottom
   32→381px. The caret clears the keyboard — but see the S3 slice row: the active line lands UNDER the
   fixed status chips, so REQ-SCROLL-1 is required before REQ-MOBILE-2 can be called done.

   ⚠️ **TWO FALSE LEADS — recorded so nobody re-derives them.**
   (a) *"`visualViewport` is inert too"* — **WRONG.** It reports 952→**578** on the phone (≈ the same
   373px), so the plan's original Plan B does work. (b) *"`env(safe-area-inset-*)` returns 0 on physical
   hardware while the AVD says 52"* — **WRONG, and self-inflicted.** Both came from the same mistake:
   registering `ViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener` **on the WebView**, which REPLACES the
   WebView's own inset handling — precisely how Chrome derives `env()` *and* updates `visualViewport`.
   It silently zeroed both, and presented convincingly as a device/emulator platform difference. Moving
   the listener to the **decorView** restores both (`env` 68px top / 24px bottom on the phone).
   **Rule: never attach an apply-insets listener to the Tauri WebView.**
   Also note the AVD is a poor IME test rig at all: with a hardware keyboard attached it shows Gboard's
   *floating* mini-toolbar, which occludes nothing, so `ime=0` there is correct and meaningless.
   **Follow-up (deliberately deferred, Stephen 2026-07-20):** since `visualViewport` does work, the ~40
   lines of Kotlin could likely be replaced by ~4 lines of TS
   (`visualViewport.addEventListener('resize', ...)` → set `--kb-inset`), which would also cover
   web/PWA. Not swapped now: S3's acceptance is already met and demonstrable, and changing the
   mechanism deserves its own tested change (100%-coverage gate applies) rather than being smuggled in
   at the end of the slice.
5. ✅ **RESOLVED (S3, 2026-07-20) — `env()` works; the danger is CLOBBERING it.** Measured with the
   apply-insets listener correctly on the decorView: `env(safe-area-inset-top)` = **52px** on the AVD and
   **68px** on a physical Pixel 9 Pro (bottom 24px = the gesture bar). So the S2 CSS inset strategy is
   sound and **no native safe-area bridge is needed** — an earlier `--sat/--sab` bridge was built on the
   false premise in risk #4(b) and has been reverted. targetSdk 36 still makes edge-to-edge mandatory,
   which is why we handle insets rather than opt out. The one real hazard is documented in risk #4:
   attaching an apply-insets listener to the **WebView** zeroes `env()` on all four edges.
6. **Resolved:** the SDK level needs **no hand-edit** — Tauri's `gen/android/app/build.gradle.kts`
   template already defaults `compileSdk = 36` + `targetSdk = 36` (AGP 8.11.0 + Gradle 8.14 support it),
   so only `minSdk` is set (via `tauri.conf.json`, not a Gradle hand-edit). Re-confirm the defaults hold
   after `init`, since a future Tauri version could change the template.
7. SAF durability: persisted URI permissions surviving restarts + `DocumentFile.lastModified()` as a
   trustworthy rev across document providers (may degrade `conflictDetection=false`).
8. Deep-link redirect capture (`onOpenUrl` vs `getCurrent` cold-start) + the native GIS Picker have thin
   precedent — highest-uncertainty cloud items.
9. `tauri-action` Android support is **experimental** — pin the version and confirm the mobile input, or
   hand-roll the Gradle+signing CI job.

## Decisions (resolved 2026-07-18 — Stephen)

1. **Scope of M6 → local + Drive sign-in; the Picker is deferred to M6.1.** M6 ships **S1–S6** (a
   local-first Android editor + Google Drive sign-in and read/write of already-known file IDs). Opening
   *pre-existing* Drive files via the native GIS Picker (was S7) becomes **M6.1** — the
   highest-uncertainty item, cut from the M6 line.
2. **Android redirect → https App Link** (not a custom URI scheme). Stephen hosts the verification file;
   setup below (§ [App Link setup](#app-link-setup-decision-2)).
3. **SAF → spike the official `tauri-plugin-dialog` + `tauri-plugin-fs` path first** (content:// via
   `FilePath::Url`), before reaching for `tauri-plugin-android-fs` or a custom Kotlin plugin — add those
   only for what the official path can't do (persistable permissions / `DocumentFile` metadata).
4. **Distribution → sideload signed APK for M6.** The Play Store (AAB + Console + review) is kept open
   as its **own later milestone** — a real requirement (**REQ-PLAY-1**), not part of M6. See
   [roadmap.md](roadmap.md).
5. **SDK levels → minSdk 24, compileSdk/targetSdk 36** (Android 16). _Updated 2026-07-19 (was
   targetSdk 35)._ **36 is Tauri's out-of-the-box template default** — `gen/android/app/build.gradle.kts`
   hardcodes `compileSdk = 36`/`targetSdk = 36`, and Tauri's bundled **AGP 8.11.0 + Gradle 8.14** clear
   the compileSdk-36 minimum (AGP ≥ 8.9.1 / Gradle ≥ 8.11.1). So there's **no `gen/android` hand-edit**
   for the SDK level — only `minSdk` (via `tauri.conf.json > bundle.android.minSdkVersion`). Chosen over
   35 because: (a) we handle insets rather than opt out, so Android 16's mandatory edge-to-edge adds no
   work; (b) NDK r28+ already covers the 16 KB page rule Android 16 wants; (c) it matches the installed
   platform (android-36). Re-confirm the template default holds after `init`.

### App Link setup (decision 2)

The OAuth/Picker redirect on Android is an **https App Link** that Android verifies (via a hosted
`assetlinks.json`) and routes into szmde, so the Custom Tab returns to the app. One-time setup, split
between you and the code:

**You — hosting + Cloud Console:**
1. Host a static file at **`https://zhaostephen.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json`** (real HTTPS,
   `Content-Type: application/json`, no redirect) authorizing the app to handle the domain's links:
   ```json
   [{
     "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
     "target": {
       "namespace": "android_app",
       "package_name": "com.zhaostephen.szmde",
       "sha256_cert_fingerprints": ["<DEBUG SHA-256>", "<RELEASE SHA-256>"]
     }
   }]
   ```
   Get the SHA-256s from `keytool -list -v -keystore <keystore>` — for **both** the debug keystore
   (usually `~/.android/debug.keystore`, password `android`) and your release upload keystore.
2. In the **Android OAuth client** (Cloud Console), set the redirect to a path under that verified
   domain, e.g. `https://zhaostephen.com/szmde/oauth2redirect`. (No "Advanced Settings" toggle — that's
   only for the custom-URI-scheme option we're not using.)

**The code (S6):** `tauri-plugin-deep-link` in `tauri.conf.json > plugins > deep-link`:
`{"mobile":[{"scheme":["https"],"host":"zhaostephen.com","pathPrefix":["/szmde"],"appLink":true}]}` —
the plugin emits the intent filter with `android:autoVerify="true"`, and `onOpenUrl` captures the
redirect (`code`/`picked_file_ids`). `gdrive-connect.ts`'s `redirectUri` is mobile-gated to the App
Link URL.

_Gotcha: verification only succeeds once `assetlinks.json` is live AND the installed app's signing-cert
SHA-256 is listed — validate with the debug cert first, add the release cert before shipping._

## Process

⚠️ **Known traceability gap (recorded 2026-07-20, S3 review).** `REQ-MOBILE-1/2/3` are **not** in
[requirements.md](requirements.md), so `npm run test:trace` passing is **not** evidence that the Android
milestone is covered — those REQs are simply outside the audit's universe. The gate is green over an
untested requirement. That is defensible while the REQs are still being built (requirements.md tracks
BUILT requirements with linked tests), but it must not be mistaken for coverage: the real verification
for M6 is the on-device workflow suite (**WF-29** layout, **WF-30** keyboard), which is judgement-run,
not CI-gated. Fold the REQs into requirements.md — or into the tracked-gaps list — as each slice's
behavior stabilises, so the audit universe eventually includes them.


Built requirements move into [requirements.md](requirements.md) with linked tests as each slice lands;
device-only behavior (keyboard/IME, SAF round-trip, deep-link capture) gets an LLM workflow in
[llm-workflow-tests.md](llm-workflow-tests.md) run on a real device/emulator. Run the adversarial
"ultracode" review on substantial slices before merge.
